# Code Cleanup and Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines a systematic approach to improve code readability and maintainability without changing any existing functionality. The focus is on making the codebase cleaner, easier to read, and easier to maintain.

## Status Legend
- ðŸ”´ Not Started
- ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- ðŸŸ¢ Completed
- âš« Blocked

## Phase 1: Component Structure & Organization ðŸŸ¢

### 1. Consistent Component Structure ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Standardize import order (React hooks, components, utils, styles)
- [x] Group related state variables together
- [x] Move callback functions below state declarations
- [x] Ensure prop destructuring follows consistent patterns

### 2. Extract Complex Logic ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Move complex data transformations to separate utility functions
- [x] Extract large JSX sections into smaller sub-components
- [x] Create dedicated hooks for repeated state management patterns

### 3. Component Simplification ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Break down large components (>250 lines) into smaller ones
- [x] Move business logic outside of render functions
- [x] Refactor inline anonymous functions to named functions

## Phase 2: JavaScript Cleanup ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Redundant Logic Removal ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Identify and eliminate duplicate code blocks
- [x] Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
- [x] Check for and remove redundant null/undefined checks

### 2. Performance Optimizations ðŸŸ¡
- [x] Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback
- [ ] Add memoization with useMemo for expensive calculations
- [x] Apply React.memo to appropriate components

### 3. Code Readability ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Add meaningful variable names (avoid abbreviations)
- [x] Use destructuring for cleaner prop and state access
- [x] Replace complex conditions with readable helper functions
- [x] Use early returns to reduce nesting

## Phase 3: CSS/Styling Cleanup ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Style Organization ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Group related styles together (layout, typography, colors)
- [x] Use consistent naming convention for CSS classes
- [x] Remove unused styles and duplicate declarations
- [x] Properly scope CSS Module selectors
- [x] Implement SASS variables and mixins consistently

### 2. Style Simplification ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Consolidate similar styles into reusable classes
- [x] Extract common values into CSS variables
- [x] Reduce specificity where possible for easier overrides
- [x] Create dedicated style modules for components
- [x] Remove duplicate styles between components

### 3. Responsive Design Cleanup ðŸŸ¡
- [x] Organize media queries consistently
- [ ] Remove redundant responsive styles
- [x] Ensure mobile-first approach consistently
- [x] Use SASS mixins for breakpoints

## Phase 4: Project-wide Improvements ðŸŸ¡

### 1. TypeScript Improvements (if applicable) ðŸ”´
- [ ] Add or improve type definitions
- [ ] Remove any/unknown types where possible
- [ ] Create reusable type definitions for common structures

### 2. Documentation ðŸŸ¡
- [x] Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
- [ ] Document component props with PropTypes or TypeScript
- [x] Add examples for reusable components

### 3. File Organization ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Group related components in appropriate directories
- [x] Create index files for cleaner imports
- [x] Organize utility functions by domain/purpose

## Implementation Approach

### For Each Component
1. Document current behavior and props âœ…
2. Identify redundant or overly complex sections âœ…
3. Refactor in small, testable increments âœ…
4. Verify functionality remains unchanged âœ…
5. Document changes made âœ…

### Priority Components
1. `PositionsList.js` âœ… - Split into smaller components, added custom hooks
2. `PnLDisplay.js` âœ… - Split into smaller components, improved error handling
3. Core utility files (`positionUtils.js`, `formatters.js`) âœ… - Refactored for clarity, consistency, and error handling
4. Higher-order components and context providers ðŸ”´
5. Shared UI components ðŸŸ¡ - Table components completed

## Testing Strategy
- âœ… Ensure visual regression tests pass
- âœ… Manually verify all interactions work as before
- âœ… Test edge cases (empty data, loading states, errors)
- âœ… Confirm all optimized API responses still display correctly
