### Phase 5: Insightful Analytics & Visualization ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
*Focus: Transform raw data into actionable insights.*

1.  âœ… **Implement Key Derived Metrics**: (completed)
    *   âœ… Created API backend in `/api/pools.js` for:
        * Fee APR calculation (based on `fees` / `tvl_usdc` over timeframes)
        * Volume/TVL Ratio calculation (capital efficiency indicator)
        * Volatility classification (Low/Medium/High)
    *   âœ… Implemented usePoolData hook with caching for efficient data retrieval
    *   âœ… Created PoolMetrics component to display derived metrics
    *   âœ… Fixed data fetching and calculation issues:
        * Corrected API data structure handling for DeFiTuna API responses
        * Properly parsed string numeric values returned by the API
        * Implemented proper error handling throughout the data flow
        * Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
    *   âœ… Integration completed:
        * Added metrics to Pool Detail page with Performance Metrics section
        * Added metrics to Pool Cards

2.  ðŸ”„ **Create Focused Historical Charts**:
    *   Implement time-series charts on the Pool Detail page for **Fee APR** and **TVL**.

3.  ðŸ”„ **Develop Contextual Tooltips & Explanations**:
    *   Enhance all metric tooltips to explain *what the metric means for the user* and *how to interpret it* (e.g., "High Fee APR suggests good returns for LPs based on recent activity, but check volatility").
    *   Add info icons with brief explanations for key concepts like impermanent loss risk (without complex calculations yet).
    *   **Value add**: Educate users and build confidence in interpreting the data.
    *   **Action Item**: Review and rewrite all tooltips with a focus on user implications.

### Phase 6: User Convenience & Decision Support ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

*   **Robustness**: Ensure calculations are sound and the application is reliable.

## Success Metrics
*   User feedback indicating the tool helps them make **better/faster decisions** compared to raw data sources.
*   Active use of **derived metrics** (Fee APR) and **risk indicators** in filtering/sorting.
*   High usage of **comparison** and **watchlist** features.
*   Low bounce rate, indicating users find the presented information valuable and engaging.
