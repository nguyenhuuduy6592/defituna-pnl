# DeFi Tuna PnL Testing Strategy

## 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup (Priority: High) ✅
- [x] Install testing dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom
  ```
- [x] Configure Jest for Next.js environment
- [x] Set up test scripts in package.json
- [x] Configure test coverage reporting

## 2. Testing Principles and Guidelines

*   **Test Existing Code First:** Prioritize writing tests that verify the current behavior of the code *as it exists*, without modifying the source file initially. The primary goal is to lock in current functionality before any refactoring.
*   **Focus on Accuracy:** Design tests to validate core logic, known edge cases (null/undefined inputs, empty arrays/objects, boundary values), and expected error handling based *only* on the current implementation.
*   **Promote Speed:** Leverage test utilities, effective mocking (especially for external dependencies like APIs or complex libraries), and consider snapshot testing for components to accelerate test writing. Focus on testing the most critical paths first.
*   **Separate Testing from Refactoring:** If potential refactorings or improvements to the source code are identified during test writing that would enhance testability, functionality, or clarity, **do not modify the source file immediately**. Instead, document these suggestions within the relevant file's status section in this plan (e.g., under "Next Priorities" or "Known Issues") for later review, prioritization, and implementation as separate tasks.
*   **Handling Coverage Targets:** Strive to meet the defined coverage targets for each file/directory. However, if a target proves unreachable *solely by testing the existing, unmodified code paths*, mark the file's testing status as "Tested (Existing Code)". In such cases, add specific, actionable suggestions to this plan detailing how the *source file* could be refactored (e.g., breaking down large functions, injecting dependencies, making error paths more explicit) to improve its testability and allow coverage targets to be met in a subsequent refactoring effort.
* **Keep plan up-to-date:** Always keep the plan up-to-date. Update the plan after every step, every change.

3. Continue Context Tests:
   - ✅ ComparisonContext (100% coverage)
   - Start with PositionContext next
   - Then implement tests for ThemeContext and WalletContext

4. Page Testing Strategy:
   - Define approach for testing pages with complex integration needs
   - Start with simpler page tests

5. Infrastructure:
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Implement pre-commit hooks for test runs

## 7. Known Issues

- Several tests fail in Portal and TooltipPortal components due to "Target container is not a DOM element" errors
  - This is likely related to React 19 and testing-library compatibility
  - Need to update the test setup for these portal-based components
- Warnings in ImpermanentLossExplainer tests about invalid DOM nesting (div within p)
  - This indicates a potential issue in the component that should be addressed
- Overall coverage significantly below targets (73.68% vs 85% target)
- Integration and E2E tests pending
- Need to add snapshot testing for components
- React act() warnings appear in tests for usePoolsData.js and useDebounceApi.js due to internal state updates
- debounce.js has lower coverage (61.19%) due to complex async behavior that's difficult to test
- tokens.js has lower coverage (73.01%) primarily in error handling paths
- styles.js has minimal coverage (14.28%)

### Testing Adaptations Required
Several components required testing adaptations to avoid modifying source code:
- **WalletForm Component**:
  - Form element lacks `role="form"` attribute, so tests needed to use `container.querySelector('form')` instead of `screen.getByRole('form')`
  - This approach follows our "Separate Testing from Refactoring" principle but would benefit from future accessibility improvements
  - **Potential Enhancement:** Add `role="form"` attribute to the form element for better accessibility and easier testing
- **PnLCard Component**:
  - Several UI elements like "Out of range" status indicators were not directly accessible in tests
  - Alternative approaches like checking for element presence were used instead of text content
  - **Potential Enhancement:** Add data-testid attributes to key elements to simplify testing
