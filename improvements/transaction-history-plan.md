# DeFiTuna Transaction History Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to implement transaction history tracking for all past and current positions of active wallets in DeFiTuna using the Helius API. The implementation will allow users to view the complete transaction history of their positions, providing deeper insights into their trading activities.

## Requirements

1. Track all transactions for the active wallet's positions
2. Parse transactions using DeFiTuna IDL to identify specific operation types
3. Store transaction data efficiently for quick retrieval
4. Display transaction history with relevant position details
5. Filter and sort transaction history by various parameters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

1. **Helius API Integration**
   - Set up Helius API key and configuration
   - Create helper utilities to handle rate limiting and retry logic
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls

2. **IDL Parser Development**
   - Import and configure DeFiTuna IDL for transaction parsing
   - Create parser utilities to extract position-related data from transactions
   - Develop a classification system for different transaction types

### Phase 2: Data Retrieval and Processing

3. **Fetching Transactions**
   - Implement function to fetch historical transactions for a wallet
   - Set up pagination to handle large transaction volumes
   - Implement date range filters to optimize data retrieval

4. **Position Identification**
   - Create logic to associate transactions with specific positions
   - Develop algorithm to reconstruct position lifecycle from transactions
   - Implement filters to identify only DeFiTuna-related transactions

5. **Transaction Parsing**
   - Parse transaction data using IDL to extract relevant details
   - Classify transactions by operation type (open, close, liquidate, etc.)
   - Extract position parameters (size, leverage, etc.) from instruction data

### Phase 3: Data Storage and Management

6. **Local Storage Implementation**
   - Design schema for storing transaction history
   - Implement indexedDB or localStorage solution for client-side persistence
   - Set up efficient queries for retrieving transaction history

7. **Synchronization Logic**
   - Develop mechanism to sync local data with blockchain
   - Implement differential sync to minimize API calls
   - Set up background refresh mechanism for active users

### Phase 4: User Interface

8. **Transaction History UI**
   - Design transaction history list/table view
   - Implement position-specific transaction history modal
   - Develop transaction detail view for individual transactions

9. **Filtering and Sorting**
   - Implement filters for transaction type, date range, position, etc.
   - Create sorting options for various transaction attributes
   - Develop search functionality for transaction history

10. **Data Visualization**
    - Design timeline visualization for position lifecycle
    - Implement charts to show position changes over time
    - Create visual indicators for significant events (liquidation risks, etc.)

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization

11. **Testing**
    - Create test cases for different transaction scenarios
    - Test with various wallet histories and position types
    - Implement load testing for large transaction volumes

12. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize API call frequency and data fetching
    - Implement lazy loading and virtualization for large history lists
    - Optimize storage utilization for long-term use

## Technical Details

### Helius API Integration

1. **Endpoint Selection**
   - Use Helius `/v0/addresses/{address}/transactions` endpoint for history
   - Leverage enhanced transaction data format for additional metadata
   - Consider using webhook notifications for real-time updates

2. **Transaction Parsing Strategy**
   - First pass: Filter transactions by program ID (DeFiTuna's ID)
   - Second pass: Parse instruction data using IDL
   - Third pass: Classify and organize by position

3. **Data Extraction Points**
   - Transaction signature (for unique identification)
   - Block time (for chronological ordering)
   - Instruction data (for operation details)
   - Account references (for position identification)
   - Inner instructions (for fee/yield tracking)

### Position History Reconstruction

1. **Position Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Opening transaction: Initial parameters, collateral, leverage
   - Modification transactions: Changes to position parameters
   - Closing/liquidation: Final state and outcome
   - Yield/fee transactions: Ongoing revenue or expenses

2. **Data Association Keys**
   - Position address as primary key
   - Wallet address as secondary key
   - Trading pair as tertiary grouping

### Storage Requirements

1. **Transaction Data Schema**
   ```
   {
     signature: string,           // Transaction signature
     blockTime: number,           // Unix timestamp
     positionAddress: string,     // Associated position
     operationType: string,       // Open, close, modify, etc.
     pair: string,                // Trading pair
     details: {                   // Operation-specific details
       // Varies by operation type
     },
     amount: number,              // Transaction amount (if applicable)
     fees: number                 // Transaction fees
   }
   ```

2. **Estimated Storage Size**
   - Average transaction: ~2KB
   - 100 transactions: ~200KB
   - 1000 transactions: ~2MB per wallet

## Considerations & Challenges

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Helius has rate limits that need to be managed
   - Implement caching and batching to reduce API calls
   - Consider premium API tiers for high-volume users

2. **Large Transaction Volumes**
   - Active traders may have thousands of transactions
   - Implement pagination and virtual scrolling
   - Consider incremental loading strategies

3. **IDL Version Compatibility**
   - DeFiTuna IDL may change over time
   - Implement version detection and handling
   - Support parsing of legacy transaction formats

4. **Privacy Considerations**
   - All data is kept client-side
   - No server storage of user transaction data
   - Clear storage options for users

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (Infrastructure): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Data Retrieval): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Storage): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4 (UI): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 5 (Testing & Optimization): 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 7-12 weeks depending on complexity and resources.

## Future Enhancements
